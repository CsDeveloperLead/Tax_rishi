        title: "Capital Gains Tax on Property Sale: What You Need to Know",
        image: img2,
        description: `
Selling property is a significant financial decision, and understanding its tax implications
under the Income-tax Act, 1961 is crucial for all property owners. Whether you've already
sold a property or are considering doing so, navigating the complexities of capital gains tax
is vital for proper financial planning and compliance with the law.

Capital gains arise when you sell an asset, such as property, at a profit. These gains are
categorized into two types: Short-term Capital Gains (STCG) and Long-term Capital
Gains (LTCG), each with its own tax rates and rules.

<strong>Key Amendments in Budget 2024 </strong>
The Union Budget 2024 introduced important changes to the taxation of capital gains,
applicable from FY 2024-25:
1. Revised Holding Periods:
   o For all listed securities, the holding period to qualify as long-term is 12
   months.
   o For immovable property, such as land and buildings, the long-term holding
   period is 24 months.
   The previous 36-month holding period has been abolished.
2. Long-term vs Short-term:
   Properties held for more than 24 months are classified as long-term, while those sold
   within 24 months are considered short-term.
3. New Tax Rates for Long-term Capital Gains (LTCG):
   o 20% tax with indexation for properties sold before 23rd July 2024.
   o 12.5% tax without indexation for properties sold on or after 23rd July 2024.
   This rule applies only to properties acquired before 22nd July 2024. Properties
   bought after this date will have a fixed 12.5% LTCG tax without indexation.

Understanding Capital Gains on Property Sale
Short-term Capital Gain (STCG):
If you sell property within 24 months of acquisition, the gains are considered short-term and
taxed according to your income tax slab rate. For example, if your short-term gain is ₹6 lakh
and you fall in the 30% tax bracket, you’ll pay 31.20% tax, amounting to ₹1.87 lakh.

Long-term Capital Gain (LTCG):
If the property is sold after 24 months, it is considered a long-term capital gain. The tax rate
for LTCG is 20% with indexation (for sales before 23rd July 2024) or 12.5% without
indexation (for sales on or after this date).

How to Calculate Capital Gains
Both STCG and LTCG are calculated using the formula:
 Sale Consideration
Less: Cost of Acquisition
Less: Cost of Improvement
Less: Transfer Expenses
For LTCG, you can also deduct the Indexed Cost of Acquisition and Indexed Cost of
Improvement, which adjusts the original cost for inflation, thus lowering your tax liability.
The indexation benefit helps reduce taxable gains by factoring in inflation over the period the
property was held.

Example of LTCG Calculation
Suppose Mr. B purchased a residential apartment in January 2017 for ₹20 lakh and spent ₹2
lakh on interiors in May 2020. If he sells the property in May 2024 for ₹60 lakh, his LTCG
calculation would be:
 Sale Consideration: ₹60,00,000
 Indexed Cost of Acquisition: ₹27,50,000
 Indexed Cost of Improvement: ₹2,66,911
 Long-term Capital Gain: ₹29,83,089
 LTCG tax @ 20%: ₹5,96,618
If Mr. B sells the same property in August 2024, the LTCG tax rate would be 12.5%, and the
tax liability would be ₹4,75,000.

Tax Planning Tips
For properties acquired before 1st April 2001, taxpayers can opt to use the Fair Market
Value (FMV) of the property as of 1st April 2001 as the cost of acquisition. This can
significantly reduce taxable gains, as it increases the cost base for indexation.

Exemptions under Sections 54, 54EC, and 54F allow taxpayers to save on capital gains tax
if they reinvest the proceeds in specified assets, such as purchasing another residential
property or investing in government bonds.

Set-off & Carry Forward of Losses
 Short-term capital losses can be offset against both short-term and long-term gains.
 Long-term capital losses can only be offset against long-term gains. Any excess
losses can be carried forward for up to 8 years.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. Is capital gains tax applicable on the sale of gold or jewelry?
   Yes, capital gains tax applies if you sell gold or jewelry. If held for more than 2 years,
   it qualifies as long-term capital gains and is taxed at 12.5% without indexation.
2. What if my gold was bought before 1st April 2001?
   You can use the Fair Market Value (FMV) as of 1st April 2001 as your cost of
   acquisition. However, no indexation benefit is allowed.
3. Which ITR form should I file for capital gains on property or gold?
   Use ITR-2 or ITR-3 (if you have business income) to report capital gains.
4. How do I calculate the cost of acquisition for ancestral property?
   The cost to the previous owner is considered your cost of acquisition. For properties
   acquired before 1st April 2001, use the FMV as of that date.

Conclusion
Selling property involves more than just finding a buyer. Understanding capital gains tax
and the recent Budget 2024 amendments can help taxpayers make informed decisions,
minimize tax liabilities, and plan effectively for future investments.

For detailed guidance on calculating and saving capital gains tax, consult with a tax
professional or advisor.

Healthy eating is the cornerstone of a vibrant and fulfilling life. It’s not about restrictive diets or temporary fads—it’s about making sustainable choices that nourish your body, mind, and soul. 

A balanced diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. These foods provide essential nutrients that fuel your body, boost energy levels, and support overall health. Simple swaps, like choosing whole-grain bread over white or snacking on nuts instead of chips, can make a big difference.

Hydration is equally important. Drinking enough water helps maintain bodily functions, improves skin health, and keeps you energized throughout the day. Avoid sugary drinks and opt for water or herbal teas to stay refreshed.

Meal planning and mindful eating are powerful tools for adopting a healthy lifestyle. Preparing meals at home allows you to control ingredients and portion sizes, while eating mindfully helps you savor flavors and prevent overeating.

Remember, healthy eating is a journey, not a destination. It’s about making consistent, positive choices that lead to lasting change. Start today by adding more color to your plate and taking the first step toward a healthier, happier you.`,

Sustainable living is more than an eco-friendly trend—it’s a commitment to preserving the planet while enhancing our quality of life. It involves mindful choices that reduce our impact on the environment and promote harmony with nature.

Recycling is a simple yet effective way to start. By properly disposing of paper, plastic, and glass, we reduce waste in landfills and conserve valuable resources. Composting organic waste is another excellent practice that enriches the soil and reduces emissions.

Energy conservation is vital for sustainability. Simple actions like switching to LED bulbs, unplugging devices when not in use, and using energy-efficient appliances can significantly lower your carbon footprint. Supporting renewable energy initiatives, such as solar or wind power, contributes to a greener future.

Sustainable living also extends to our consumption habits. Choosing locally-sourced, seasonal foods reduces transportation emissions and supports local farmers. Opting for reusable products over single-use items minimizes waste.

Adopting a sustainable lifestyle might seem overwhelming, but small changes add up over time. Start with one habit and build on it. Together, we can create a world that thrives in balance with the environment, ensuring a better future for generations to come.`,

Positive thinking is a transformative mindset that shapes how we perceive and respond to life’s challenges. It’s not about ignoring difficulties but about approaching them with optimism and resilience. 

This mindset starts with gratitude—acknowledging the good in our lives, no matter how small. Practicing daily affirmations and focusing on strengths rather than weaknesses helps cultivate a sense of self-confidence and purpose.

Positive thinking also improves relationships. When we approach interactions with kindness and understanding, we foster deeper connections and build trust. It inspires others, creating a ripple effect of encouragement and motivation.

Overcoming negativity requires effort. Surround yourself with uplifting influences, whether it’s supportive friends, inspiring books, or motivational podcasts. Replace self-doubt with constructive self-talk, and learn to reframe setbacks as opportunities for growth.

The benefits of positive thinking extend beyond emotional health. Studies show that optimistic individuals are more likely to achieve goals, handle stress effectively, and maintain better physical health.

Start small by practicing gratitude and celebrating small victories. Over time, positive thinking becomes a way of life, empowering you to create a brighter, more fulfilling future. Believe in yourself, and let positivity pave the way to success.`,
