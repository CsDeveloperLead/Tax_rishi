                <h2 className='text-4xl leading-[40px] font-semibold'>Compounding of offences under GST</h2>
                <h2 className='text-4xl leading-[40px] font-semibold'>What is compounding of offences?</h2>

                <p className='text-base leading-8'>
                    Compounding of offences is a shortcut method to avoid litigation. In the case of prosecution for an offence in a criminal court, the accused has to appear before the Magistrate at every hearing through an advocate. Court proceedings are time-consuming and expensive. In compounding, the accused is not required to appear personally and can be discharged on payment of compounding fee which cannot be more than the maximum fine leviable under the relevant provisions. GST Act also allows for compounding of offences.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-4xl leading-[40px] font-semibold'>Non-availability of compounding</h2>

                <p className='text-base leading-8'>

                    <li className='mt-2'>A person who had committed an offence before under GST involving supplies above Rs. 1 crore and has been allowed to compound before. Thus, it stands, any person previously enjoying compounding for goods/services over Rs. 1 crore will not enjoy compounding a second time.</li>
                    <li className='mt-2'>Any person who is also being tried under other acts such as Narcotic Drugs Act, FEMA, etc.</li>
                    <li className='mt-2'>Any person convicted by a court under GST.</li>
                    <li className='mt-2'>Any person giving false information during proceedings, or preventing the officer from his duty or destroying evidence.</li>
                    <li className='mt-2'>Offences related to fake ITC claims, possession of goods liable for confiscations, supplying services in contravention to the act, obstructing officers from performing duties, tampering evidence, and non-submission of proper information.</li>

                    *Removed and ^included through Budget 2023. CBIC is yet to notify these changes.
                </p>

                <p className='text-base leading-8'>
                    Compounding will be allowed only after payment of all tax, interest and penalty dues.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-4xl leading-[40px] font-semibold'>Amount payable for compounding</h2>

                <p className='text-base leading-8'>
                    The amount payable for compounding of offences shall be 50% of the tax involved subject to a minimum Rs. 10,000. Maximum amount for compounding is 150% of the tax OR Rs. 30,000 -Whichever is higher.
                    <br /> <br />
                    However, Budget 2023 reduced the minimum and maximum limits for compounding the offences to 25% and 100% of the tax involved. CBIC is yet to notify this amendment.
                </p>
                <h2 className='text-4xl leading-[40px] font-semibold'>Abatement of further proceedings</h2>

                <p className='text-base leading-8'>
                    On payment of the compounding amount, no further proceedings shall be initiated against the accused person for the same offence and any criminal proceedings, if already initiated, will be abated. Apart from prosecution, the offender can also be arrested. Please read our article on arrest under GST. Thus, we find that GST has severe prosecutions to punish tax evaders and the corrupt thus keeping in mind the governmentâ€™s anti-tax evasion stance.
